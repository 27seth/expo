If you have a React Native app that doesn't use any Expo tools, you might be wondering what Expo can provide for you, why you might want to use Expo tools and services, and how to get started.

**All tools and services provided by Expo work great in any React Native app**.

You can use [EAS](/eas) to get quickly set up with a professional CI/CD workflow for building, reviewing, deploying, and updating your apps. [Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/) provides the best command-line experience for working with React Native. The [Expo SDK](/versions/latest/) is an extended standard library for React Native. It gives developers high-quality, well-maintained native libraries that use consistent API conventions to make them easier to learn and use.

If you've ever written a native module for React Native, you'll be surprised how much easier it is to build and maintain modules with the idiomatic Swift and Kotlin DSL provided by the [Expo Modules API](/modules/overview/).

There's so much more to explore, and the links below will help you to explore the options available to you.

## Incremental adoption steps

There are four steps of incremental adoption to help you get started with:

### Prerequisites

Required to use Expo tools and services:

<BoxLink
  title="Install Expo modules"
  Icon={Rocket02Icon}
  description={
    <>
      To unlock Expo capabilities, you need to install <CODE>expo</CODE> package in your project in
      your existing React Native project. This guide provides both automated and manual installation
      steps.
    </>
  }
  href="/bare/installing-expo-modules"
/>

<BoxLink
  title="Use Expo CLI"
  Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
  description={
    <>
      Migrating to Expo CLI provides many benefits over <CODE>@react-native-community/cli</CODE>.
      This guide explains these benefits and provides compilation commands to start your development
      server after installing <CODE>expo</CODE> package.
    </>
  }

/>

### Quick wins

The following helps improving development experience and requires configuration:

<BoxLink
  title="Use Expo SDK"
  Icon={DocsLogo}
  description="Use one of the many libraries provided by the Expo SDK &mdash; an extensive set of libraries that provide access to native APIs."
  href="/versions/"
/>

<BoxLink
  title="Install expo-dev-client"
  Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
  description={
    <>
      <CODE>expo-dev-client</CODE> provides access to Expo Go-style app launcher interface into your
      debug app variants. Learn how to install and configure it in your existing React Native
      project.

/>

<BoxLink
  title="Write native modules"
  description="Use the Expo Modules API to write native modules using Swift and Kotlin."
  Icon={Lightbulb01Icon}
  href="/modules/overview/"

<BoxLink
  title="Native project upgrade helper"
  Icon={ChevronUpDoubleIcon}
  description="View file-by-file diffs of all the changes you need to make to your native projects to upgrade them to the next Expo SDK and React Native version."
  href="/bare/upgrade/"
/>

### New workflows

Once your app has `expo` package installed, you can submit your app to app stores with a single command or update configure `expo-updates` library to manage remote updates to you app's code:

<BoxLink
  title="App distribution"
  Icon={BuildArtifactIcon}
  description="Build and submit your app to app stores with a single command."
  href="/distribution/introduction"
/>

<BoxLink
  title="Install expo-updates"
  Icon={BuildArtifactIcon}
  description={
    <>
      Learn how to install and configure <CODE>expo-updates</CODE> to manage remote updates.
    </>
  }
  href="/bare/installing-updates/"
/>

### New mindset

The following helps with your project's long term maintainability, native code maintenance, and easier upgrades:
